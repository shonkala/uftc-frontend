<p>
 A single-page application for a team to track their progress in the Ultimate Functional Training Challenge, a fun exercise competition designed to promote an active lifestyle and get software engineers up from their desks during the work day.
 </p>

<p>
Participants record their exercises and gain points, trying to reach a set goal. Upon gaining enough points on a single activity, or during a special one-day-challenge, participants are rewarded with badges.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<p>
This was a capstone project for a University of Turku <a href="https://tech.utu.fi/fi/full-stack/" rel="noopener">Full Stack bootcamp</a>, which took place between March and August of 2019. A <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-frontend/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener">team of five</a> was given two months and free hands to design and build it. Original concept and support was provided by <a href="https://www.ambientia.fi/">Ambientia</a>.
</p>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="noopener">Node.js</a> installed.

For this React frontend to work, start the <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-backend" rel="noopener">backend server</a> on the same machine.

### Installing

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-frontend.git
cd uftc-frontend
```

Install Node.js modules.

```
npm install
```

Start the application in development mode.

```
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the login page.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The application is meant to be used by a closed group of people, like a company's employees. Therefore, creating an account works only when you enter the site at http://localhost:3000/login/secret where the term 'secret' matches the one set in the backend .env file for environment variables.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The application assumes to find the <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-backend" rel="noopener">backend server</a> running on the same host. Edit the file 'config/config.js' if this is not the case.

To build a production version.

```
npm run build
```

Copy the contents of the 'build' folder into your web server.

## üç≠ Cypress end-to-end testing

In the branch **mm_test** there is a set of end-to-end Cypress tests.

```
git checkout mm_test
npm install
npm start
```

Running the tests requires the <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-backend" rel="noopener">backend server</a> was started in **test mode**.

Make sure the .env file has defined a TEST_MONGODB_URI which is different from your development database, since the tests delete all data from Mongo.

```
git checkout mm_test
npm run watch:test
```

In the frontend folder, start the Cypress tests with

```
npm run cypress:open
```

After Cypress finishes loading, you can click at the button **run all specs** which launches a battery of tests.
